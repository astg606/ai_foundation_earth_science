# AI Foundation Models in Earth Science
## Python Frameworks Needed

### Introduction

NASA has the world’s largest collection of Earth observation data. 
This vast collection is driven by NASA mission to understand our planet as a unified system. 
These observations cover all the major disciplines within 
Earth science — land, atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and 
human dimensions (Ramachandran 2023). 

The data is used in forecasting models of the Earth system to make
them more accurate and reliable.
The models are essential for mitigating natural disasters and 
supporting human progress. 
Such tools not only provide crucial early warnings for extreme 
events but are also important for diverse applications ranging 
from agriculture to healthcare to global commerce. 
Modern Earth system predictions rely on complex models 
developed using centuries of accumulated physical knowledge, 
providing global forecasts of diverse variables for weather, 
air quality, ocean currents, sea ice and hurricanes.

Despite their vital role, Earth system forecasting models 
face several limitations. 
They are extremely computationally expensive.
Their complexity, built up over years of development by large teams, 
complicates rapid improvements and necessitates substantial time and 
expertise for effective management. 
Finally, forecasting models incorporate various approximations, 
such as those for sub-grid-scale processes, limiting accuracy. 
These challenges open the door for alternative approaches that may 
offer enhanced performance (Bodnar et al. 2025).

AI can play a critical role to address the above issues and 
to improve the discovery, access, and use of scientific data. 
AI needs to be included into internal model processes 
for more accurate predictions (with less computational requirements)
and for accelerating scientific discovery.
